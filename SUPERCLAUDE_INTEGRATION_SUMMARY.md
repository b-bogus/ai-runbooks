### Component Integration Map
- **SuperClaude Core** → AI Runbooks via RunbookExecutor
- **Personas** → Security roles with tool preferences
- **Commands** → Runbook workflows with parameter mapping
- **MCP Tools** → Security platform integrations
- **Orchestrator** → Intelligent routing and resource management

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Security Commands (`/security:*`)
Created six original security commands plus eight additional commands in `SuperClaude_Framework/SuperClaude/Commands/Security/`:

**Original Commands:**
- **`/security:triage`** - Alert triage workflow execution
- **`/security:investigate`** - Deep security investigation
- **`/security:hunt`** - Proactive threat hunting
- **`/security:respond`** - Incident response (PICERL)
- **`/security:enrich`** - IOC enrichment
- **`/security:report`** - Security reporting

**Additional Commands (New):**
- **`/security:detect`** - Detection engineering lifecycle (create, validate, tune, deploy)
- **`/security:correlate`** - Case correlation and campaign detection
- **`/security:review`** - Post-incident review and lessons learned
- **`/security:vulnerability`** - Vulnerability management and prioritization
- **`/security:metrics`** - Security operations metrics and KPIs
- **`/security:playbook`** - Dynamic playbook execution and management
- **`/security:compliance`** - Compliance validation and evidence generation
- **`/security:intel`** - Threat intelligence lifecycle management

### 2. Security Persona Integration
Created `PERSONAS_SECURITY.md` that maps your existing security personas to SuperClaude's system:
- Tier 1/2/3 SOC Analysts
- Threat Hunter
- Incident Responder
- CTI Researcher
- Detection Engineer

Each persona includes auto-activation triggers, MCP tool preferences, and command mappings.

### 3. Orchestrator Updates
Enhanced `ORCHESTRATOR.md` with security-specific:
- Pattern recognition for security keywords
- Auto-activation rules for security personas
- Security command routing in the master table
- MCP tool selection for security operations

### 4. RunbookExecutor Module
Built a complete Python module (`SuperClaude/RunbookExecutor/`) with:
- **parser.py** - Parse markdown runbooks into executable workflows
- **executor.py** - Execute workflows with MCP tool coordination
- **mcp_mapper.py** - Map runbook actions to MCP tool calls
- **validator.py** - Validate execution quality and completeness

### 5. Framework Integration
Updated core SuperClaude files:
- Added security commands to `COMMANDS.md`
- Referenced `PERSONAS_SECURITY.md` in `CLAUDE.md`
- Updated command categories and wave-enabled lists

## How It Works

### Command Flow Example
```bash
# User types:
/security:triage CHR-2024-001 --severity high

# System:
1. Activates tier1_soc_analyst persona
2. Loads triage_alerts.md runbook
3. Executes workflow steps using MCP tools
4. Generates triage report
```

### Auto-Activation Examples
- Typing "suspicious login from 192.168.1.100" → Suggests `/security:triage`
- Mentioning "APT29" → Activates threat_hunter persona
- "Ransomware incident" → Triggers `/security:respond` with incident_responder

### MCP Tool Integration
Security commands automatically coordinate:
- **chronicle_mcp** - SIEM queries and correlation
- **gti_mcp** - Threat intelligence lookups
- **soar_mcp** - Automated response actions
- **scc_mcp** - Cloud security context
- **bigquery_mcp** - Large-scale analysis

## Key Features

### 1. Natural Language Processing
Commands understand context and auto-activate appropriate personas and runbooks based on:
- Alert patterns (CHR-*, SCC-*, CASE-*)
- Security keywords (triage, investigate, threat, incident)
- Severity indicators (critical, high, medium, low)

### 2. Workflow Orchestration
- Parses markdown runbooks into executable steps
- Handles decision points and branching logic
- Maintains execution context throughout workflow
- Validates results against quality standards

### 3. Intelligent Routing
- Complexity assessment determines resource allocation
- Wave mode for complex investigations and hunts
- Parallel execution for independent operations
- Graceful degradation when tools unavailable

### 4. Comprehensive Validation
- Execution completeness checks
- Quality gates for evidence collection
- Performance monitoring
- Security and compliance validation

## Implementation Details

### Command Structure
Each security command follows a consistent structure:
```python
class SecurityCommand:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "command_name"
        self.description = "Command purpose"
        self.personas = ["tier1_soc_analyst", "tier2_soc_analyst"]
        self.runbooks = ["primary_runbook.md", "fallback_runbook.md"]
        self.mcp_tools = ["chronicle_mcp", "gti_mcp"]
        
    def parse_args(self, args):
        # Argument parsing logic
        
    def execute(self, context):
        # Command execution logic
        
    def validate_results(self, results):
        # Validation and quality checks
```

### Runbook Parser Architecture
The RunbookExecutor module parses markdown runbooks into executable workflows:

```yaml
Workflow Structure:
  - metadata: Title, personas, tools required
  - prerequisites: Conditions before execution
  - steps: Sequential/parallel execution blocks
  - decision_points: Conditional branching
  - outputs: Expected results and formats
  - validation: Success criteria
```

### MCP Tool Mapping
Runbook actions are automatically mapped to MCP tool calls:

| Runbook Action | MCP Tool | Function |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| Search logs | chronicle_mcp | search_security_events |
| Lookup entity | chronicle_mcp | lookup_entity |
| Enrich IOC | gti_mcp | get_file_report, get_domain_report |
| Check reputation | gti_mcp | get_ip_address_report |
| Create case | soar_mcp | list_cases, post_case_comment |
| Execute playbook | soar_mcp | siemplify_attach_playbook_to_alert |
| Check vulnerabilities | scc_mcp | top_vulnerability_findings |
| Run threat hunt query | bigquery_mcp | (custom queries) |

### Persona Auto-Activation Logic
The Orchestrator uses multi-factor scoring for persona activation:

```yaml
Activation Factors:
  - keyword_matching: 30% weight
  - context_analysis: 40% weight  
  - user_history: 20% weight
  - performance_metrics: 10% weight

Thresholds:
  - tier1_soc_analyst: 70% confidence
  - tier2_soc_analyst: 75% confidence
  - threat_hunter: 80% confidence
  - incident_responder: 85% confidence
  - cti_researcher: 75% confidence
```

### Wave Mode Integration
Complex security operations automatically trigger wave mode:

```yaml
Wave Triggers:
  - Investigation complexity > 0.8
  - Multiple threat actors involved
  - Cross-system correlation required
  - Timeline > 30 days
  - Evidence collection > 50 items

Wave Strategies:
  - systematic: Methodical evidence collection
  - progressive: Iterative threat hunting
  - adaptive: Dynamic incident response
  - enterprise: Large-scale investigations
```
