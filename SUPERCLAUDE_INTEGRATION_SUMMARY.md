# SuperClaude Security Commands Integration Summary

## Overview

I've successfully integrated SuperClaude-style slash commands into your AI Runbooks project, enabling seamless execution of security workflows through intuitive command interfaces. This integration bridges your existing security runbooks with SuperClaude's powerful command orchestration system.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Security Commands (`/security:*`)
Created six comprehensive security commands in `SuperClaude_Framework/SuperClaude/Commands/Security/`:

- **`/security:triage`** - Alert triage workflow execution
- **`/security:investigate`** - Deep security investigation
- **`/security:hunt`** - Proactive threat hunting
- **`/security:respond`** - Incident response (PICERL)
- **`/security:enrich`** - IOC enrichment
- **`/security:report`** - Security reporting

### 2. Security Persona Integration
Created `PERSONAS_SECURITY.md` that maps your existing security personas to SuperClaude's system:
- Tier 1/2/3 SOC Analysts
- Threat Hunter
- Incident Responder
- CTI Researcher
- Detection Engineer

Each persona includes auto-activation triggers, MCP tool preferences, and command mappings.

### 3. Orchestrator Updates
Enhanced `ORCHESTRATOR.md` with security-specific:
- Pattern recognition for security keywords
- Auto-activation rules for security personas
- Security command routing in the master table
- MCP tool selection for security operations

### 4. RunbookExecutor Module
Built a complete Python module (`SuperClaude/RunbookExecutor/`) with:
- **parser.py** - Parse markdown runbooks into executable workflows
- **executor.py** - Execute workflows with MCP tool coordination
- **mcp_mapper.py** - Map runbook actions to MCP tool calls
- **validator.py** - Validate execution quality and completeness

### 5. Framework Integration
Updated core SuperClaude files:
- Added security commands to `COMMANDS.md`
- Referenced `PERSONAS_SECURITY.md` in `CLAUDE.md`
- Updated command categories and wave-enabled lists

## How It Works

### Command Flow Example
```bash
# User types:
/security:triage CHR-2024-001 --severity high

# System:
1. Activates tier1_soc_analyst persona
2. Loads triage_alerts.md runbook
3. Executes workflow steps using MCP tools
4. Generates triage report
```

### Auto-Activation Examples
- Typing "suspicious login from 192.168.1.100" → Suggests `/security:triage`
- Mentioning "APT29" → Activates threat_hunter persona
- "Ransomware incident" → Triggers `/security:respond` with incident_responder

### MCP Tool Integration
Security commands automatically coordinate:
- **chronicle_mcp** - SIEM queries and correlation
- **gti_mcp** - Threat intelligence lookups
- **soar_mcp** - Automated response actions
- **scc_mcp** - Cloud security context
- **bigquery_mcp** - Large-scale analysis

## Key Features

### 1. Natural Language Processing
Commands understand context and auto-activate appropriate personas and runbooks based on:
- Alert patterns (CHR-*, SCC-*, CASE-*)
- Security keywords (triage, investigate, threat, incident)
- Severity indicators (critical, high, medium, low)

### 2. Workflow Orchestration
- Parses markdown runbooks into executable steps
- Handles decision points and branching logic
- Maintains execution context throughout workflow
- Validates results against quality standards

### 3. Intelligent Routing
- Complexity assessment determines resource allocation
- Wave mode for complex investigations and hunts
- Parallel execution for independent operations
- Graceful degradation when tools unavailable

### 4. Comprehensive Validation
- Execution completeness checks
- Quality gates for evidence collection
- Performance monitoring
- Security and compliance validation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Alert Triage
```bash
/security:triage CHR-2024-001
```

### Complex Investigation with Options
```bash
/security:investigate CASE-456 --type lateral_movement --depth deep --timeframe 7d
```

### Threat Hunting
```bash
/security:hunt --ttp T1055 --scope endpoints --report
```

### Incident Response
```bash
/security:respond --incident ransomware --severity critical --team "tier3_soc_analyst,security_engineer"
```

### Bulk IOC Enrichment
```bash
/security:enrich --file suspicious_iocs.txt --pivot --export enriched_iocs.json
```

### Executive Report Generation
```bash
/security:report executive --timeframe quarter --format pdf --distribute
```

## Benefits

1. **Streamlined Workflows** - Execute complex runbooks with simple commands
2. **Intelligent Assistance** - Auto-activation of appropriate personas and tools
3. **Consistency** - Standardized execution of security procedures
4. **Flexibility** - Override defaults when needed
5. **Integration** - Seamless with existing AI Runbooks structure

## Next Steps

To use these commands:

1. Commands are automatically loaded when SuperClaude starts
2. Type `/security:` to see available security commands
3. Use `--help` flag for detailed command options
4. Security personas activate automatically based on context

The integration preserves your existing runbook structure while adding powerful command-based execution capabilities. All your existing runbooks remain unchanged and can be executed through either the traditional method or these new slash commands.

## Technical Notes

- Commands follow SuperClaude's namespace pattern (`/security:`)
- Wave mode automatically activates for complex investigations
- RunbookExecutor can be extended with custom hooks
- Validation ensures quality standards are maintained
- All security MCP tools are integrated and mapped

This integration provides a solid foundation for AI-assisted security operations, combining the structure of your runbooks with the flexibility of SuperClaude's command system.
