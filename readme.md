## Example Runbook Invocation Prompts

Use these realistic prompts to invoke various security runbooks. All examples use real data extracted from the `reports/` directory:

### Alert Triage
```
Please execute the alert triage runbook for SOAR case 2194.
```
The case involves repeated authentication failures for user F.K. on host A.S.L from IP 10.1.0.4. Check for duplicate cases and perform initial entity enrichment.

### IOC Enrichment
```
Run the basic IOC enrichment runbook for the suspicious domain scarfponcho.com.
```
Threat intelligence analysis and SIEM correlation for a domain which was flagged in our environment.

```
Execute IOC enrichment for the file hash de96a6e69944335375dc1ac238336066889d9ffc7d73628ef4fe1b1b160ab32c found on host WINS-D19.
```
This was associated with PowerShell obfuscation activity by user LISAWALKER.

### Case Investigation
```
Perform a comprehensive case investigation for SOAR case 3480.
```
 This is a critical priority case involving PowerShell attacks on WINS-D19, potential data exfiltration via BigQuery, and GCP exploitation attempts. Focus on the 17 associated alerts.

### Detection Rule Analysis
```
Analyze detection rule ru_99d1f620-3fe2-41d5-918e-0e1bd2402065 (ursnif_malware_dns).
```
 I need rule validation, tuning recommendations, and analysis of recent detections for this high-severity rule.

### Threat Hunting
```
Execute the IOC threat hunt runbook for IP addresses 46.8.9.205, 46.8.9.206, and 46.8.9.207.
```
These IPs are associated with the malicious domain scarfponcho.com and need comprehensive SIEM analysis.

```
Run the advanced threat hunting runbook focusing on lateral movement techniques (PSExec, WMI) around host WINS-D19.
```
This follows the PowerShell attack activity discovered in case 3480.

### Malware Triage
```
Perform malware triage for the sample with hash de96a6e69944335375dc1ac238336066889d9ffc7d73628ef4fe1b1b160ab32c.
```
This was involved in the PowerShell obfuscation incident on WINS-D19.

### Suspicious Login Analysis
```
Execute the suspicious login triage runbook for authentication events involving user F.K. on host A.S.L from source IP 10.1.0.4.
```
This is related to case 2194 with multiple failed followed by successful logins.

### Incident Response
```
Initiate the compromised user account IRP for user LISAWALKER'
```
Evidence includes PowerShell execution with obfuscation techniques on host WINS-D19 and potential privilege escalation attempts.

### Cloud Security Analysis
```
Run the cloud vulnerability triage runbook for the BigQuery exfiltration alerts in case 3480.
```
Focus on the DLP context and Google Drive data movement patterns detected by SCC.


### Endpoint Isolation
```
Execute the basic endpoint triage and isolation runbook for host WINS-D19.
```
This system was compromised in case 3480 with PowerShell attacks and potential malware execution.

### Deep Dive Analysis
```
Perform a deep dive IOC analysis on domain scarfponcho.com using GTI collections.
```
Include malware family associations, campaign attribution, and infrastructure analysis.


### Summary
These examples demonstrate how to invoke runbooks with specific, actionable intelligence that mirrors real security operations scenarios.
