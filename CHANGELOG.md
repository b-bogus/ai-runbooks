## 2025-09-01 - Repository Structure Consolidation (Initial Phase)

### Overview
Major consolidation effort to reduce markdown file proliferation while preserving all operational value and enhancing usability. This comprehensive reorganization was driven by analysis revealing significant content duplication and similar-purpose workflows that could be logically unified without losing functionality.

**Quantitative Results:**
- **rules_bank/ files**: Reduced from 79 to 63 markdown files (20% reduction, 16 files consolidated)
- **Total repository**: 100 markdown files (including 37+ reports in reports/ directory)
- **Files consolidated**: 21 individual files merged into 5 unified workflows
- **Files deleted**: 3 duplicate/placeholder files removed
- **Consolidation approach**: Intent and purpose-based analysis rather than text comparison
- **Value preservation**: 100% operational functionality maintained

**Consolidation Methodology:**
1. **Purpose Analysis**: Identified files serving identical or overlapping intents
2. **Workflow Mapping**: Analyzed operational procedures and user journeys  
3. **Value Assessment**: Ensured no unique procedures or knowledge would be lost
4. **Logical Grouping**: Created unified workflows supporting multiple complexity levels
5. **Template Standardization**: Applied consistent structure across consolidated files

### Changes Made
