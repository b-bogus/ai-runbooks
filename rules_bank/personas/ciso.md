## Associated Runbooks

Primary workflows this persona executes or coordinates:
* Enterprise security strategy development and governance framework implementation
* Executive incident response coordination and crisis communication procedures
* Board reporting and stakeholder engagement workflows for security posture communication
* Budget planning and resource allocation processes for cybersecurity program management
* Regulatory compliance oversight and audit coordination procedures

CISOs are primarily concerned with the effectiveness, efficiency, and strategic alignment of the processes documented in runbooks, rather than executing them:

*   They review the outcomes and reports generated from incident response runbooks (`ransomware_response.md`, `compromised_user_account_response.md`, etc.) to understand incident impact and response effectiveness.
*   They assess the value and findings from threat hunting runbooks (`apt_threat_hunt.md`, `advanced_threat_hunting.md`) to gauge proactive defense capabilities.
*   They oversee the processes defined in detection engineering runbooks (`detection_rule_validation_tuning.md`, `detection_as_code_workflows.md`) and review associated metrics.
*   They ensure runbooks align with overall security policy, compliance requirements, and strategic objectives.
