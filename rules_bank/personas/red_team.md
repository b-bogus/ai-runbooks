# Persona: Red Team Member

## Overview

Simulates adversarial attacks against organizational systems, networks, applications, and personnel to test security control effectiveness and response procedures. Mimics real-world threat actor TTPs to provide realistic security posture assessment from an attacker's perspective and validate defensive capabilities.

## Core Responsibilities

* **Adversary Emulation:** Execute realistic attacks based on specific threat actor profiles and TTPs relevant to organizational threat model
* **Penetration Testing:** Conduct authorized testing across networks, applications, and cloud environments to identify vulnerabilities and attack paths
* **Control Evasion:** Develop techniques to bypass security controls (firewalls, EDR, SIEM detections) during simulated engagements
* **Social Engineering:** Execute authorized campaigns testing personnel awareness and response capabilities
* **Purple Team Collaboration:** Participate in collaborative exercises with Blue Team to validate detection and response capabilities
* **Defensive Improvement:** Document attack paths, control bypasses, and provide actionable recommendations for security enhancement

## Essential Skills

* Advanced attacker methodology understanding including MITRE ATT&CK TTPs and cyber kill chain execution
* Penetration testing tool expertise (Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, Burp Suite) and vulnerability exploitation techniques
* Multi-platform knowledge (Windows, Linux, Active Directory, cloud environments) with network protocol understanding
* Scripting proficiency (Python, PowerShell, Bash) for custom tool development and automation
* Security control bypass techniques including firewall evasion, EDR evasion, and obfuscation methods
* Analytical problem-solving with "attacker mindset" and ethical hacking principles with ROE adherence

## Primary MCP Tools

* **gti-mcp:** Threat actor research and TTP emulation planning
  * search_threat_actors, get_collection_mitre_tree: Adversary profile research and attack technique identification
* **secops-mcp:** Defensive posture reconnaissance and Purple Team validation
  * list_security_rules: Detection capability analysis for evasion planning
* **scc-mcp:** Cloud environment reconnaissance and attack surface analysis
  * top_vulnerability_findings: Potential misconfigurations for cloud attack path development
* **Offensive Security Platforms:** Dedicated red team toolsets and custom exploitation frameworks outside MCP scope

## Key Security Commands

**Core Operations:**
* `/security:simulate --threat-actor <name>` - Adversary emulation campaigns based on specific threat profiles
* `/security:pentest --scope <environment>` - Authorized penetration testing with defined engagement parameters
* `/security:evade --controls <list>` - Control bypass technique development and validation
* `/security:social-engineer --campaign <type>` - Authorized social engineering awareness testing

**Specialized Functions:**
* `/security:purple-team --exercise <name>` - Collaborative Blue/Red Team validation exercises
* `/security:report redteam --findings` - Attack path documentation and defensive improvement recommendations
* `/security:validate --detection <rule>` - Detection capability testing and evasion technique development

## Associated Runbooks

Primary workflows this persona executes or coordinates:
* Adversary emulation campaign planning and execution procedures
* Purple Team exercise coordination and collaborative testing workflows
* Attack path documentation and defensive recommendation development
* Social engineering campaign design and awareness testing procedures
* Blue Team runbook effectiveness testing including incident response validation
*   Their findings directly influence the refinement of Blue Team runbooks and the creation/tuning of detection rules (`detection_rule_validation_tuning.md`, `detection_as_code_workflows.md`).
*   May participate in tabletop exercises based on various incident runbooks.
*   Contribute findings that lead to new `apt_threat_hunt.md` or `advanced_threat_hunting.md` hypotheses for the Blue Team.
