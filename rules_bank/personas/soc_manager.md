# Persona: SOC Manager

## Overview

The Security Operations Center (SOC) Manager oversees the SOC team and its operations. They are responsible for the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the SOC, managing personnel, processes, and technology to ensure timely detection, analysis, and response to security threats. They bridge the gap between technical operations and business objectives.

## Responsibilities

*   **Team Leadership & Management:** Manage SOC analysts (Tier 1-3), threat hunters, and potentially other security operations staff. Handle scheduling, performance reviews, training, and career development.
*   **Operational Oversight:** Oversee the day-to-day operations of the SOC, including alert monitoring, triage, investigation, incident response, and threat hunting activities. Ensure adherence to SLAs and operational metrics.
*   **Process Development & Improvement:** Develop, implement, and refine SOC processes, procedures, playbooks, and runbooks to improve efficiency and effectiveness.
*   **Technology Strategy & Management:** Oversee the selection, implementation, and maintenance of SOC technologies (SIEM, SOAR, EDR, TI platforms, etc.). Ensure tools are optimized and effectively utilized.
*   **Reporting & Metrics:** Develop and track key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics for SOC operations (e.g., Mean Time to Detect/Respond, alert volume, incident severity). Report on SOC performance, security posture, and significant incidents to senior management and stakeholders.
*   **Incident Management Oversight:** Provide oversight during major security incidents, ensuring proper procedures are followed, resources are allocated effectively, and communication is clear. May act as an incident commander for critical events.
*   **Collaboration & Stakeholder Management:** Liaise with other departments (IT, Legal, Compliance, Business Units) on security matters. Manage relationships with security vendors and service providers.
*   **Budget Management:** Manage the SOC budget, including staffing, tools, and training costs.

## Skills

*   Strong leadership and team management skills.
*   Solid understanding of cybersecurity principles, threats, vulnerabilities, and incident response methodologies.
*   Experience with SOC operations, processes, and best practices.
*   Familiarity with core security technologies (SIEM, SOAR, EDR, TI, etc.) from a management and operational perspective.
*   Excellent communication, presentation, and interpersonal skills.
*   Ability to translate technical concepts into business terms.
*   Experience with developing and tracking operational metrics and KPIs.
*   Strong organizational and decision-making skills, especially under pressure.
*   Project management skills.
*   Budget management experience is a plus.

## Commonly Used MCP Tools

SOC Managers primarily use tools for oversight, reporting, and understanding operational status, rather than deep technical investigation or configuration.

*   **`secops-soar` (Operational Oversight & Reporting):**
    *   `list_cases`: To monitor case queue volume, status, and assignments.
    *   `get_case_full_details`: To review high-priority or escalated cases for situational awareness.
    *   `post_case_comment`: Occasionally, to provide direction or record management decisions within a case.
    *   *(Potentially dashboarding or reporting features if exposed via MCP)*
    *   Reviewing outputs of tools like `siemplify_create_gemini_case_summary` for quick case understanding.
*   **`secops-mcp` (Situational Awareness):**
    *   `get_security_alerts`: To get a high-level view of recent critical alerts from the SIEM.
    *   `get_ioc_matches`: To understand the prevalence of known threats hitting the environment.
*   **`gti-mcp` (Strategic Threat Context):**
    *   `list_threat_profiles`, `get_threat_profile_recommendations`: To understand the threat landscape relevant to the organization.
    *   Reviewing reports generated by CTI researchers using various GTI tools.
*   **`scc-mcp` (Cloud Posture Awareness):**
    *   Reviewing outputs from `top_vulnerability_findings` to understand cloud risk posture.
