# Runbook: Generate Detection Report

## Objective

To summarize the findings, logic, and performance of a specific detection rule or set of related rules for review, tuning documentation, management reporting, or detection capability assessment. This runbook creates comprehensive reports that capture rule effectiveness, performance metrics, tuning history, and recommendations for optimization or retirement.

## Scope

Focuses on analyzing existing information about detection rules including alert volume, true/false positive rates, coverage analysis, and performance metrics. Includes correlation with SOAR case outcomes to assess rule effectiveness. May include data from recent validation or tuning efforts but doesn't typically involve executing new validation steps. Excludes rule development or modification activities - those are covered by Detection-as-Code workflows.

## Inputs

*   `${RULE_ID}` or `${RULE_IDS}`: The identifier(s) of the detection rule(s) to report on.
*   *(Optional) `${REPORT_TIMEFRAME_DAYS}`: Timeframe for performance data (e.g., 90).*
*   *(Optional) `${CASE_ID}`: Relevant SOAR case ID if the report relates to a specific incident or tuning effort.*

## Tools

*   `secops-mcp`: `list_security_rules`, `get_security_alerts` (for performance data)
*   `secops-soar`: `get_case_full_details`, `post_case_comment` (for context/documentation)
*   **Action:** Generate report file (e.g., using `write_to_file`)

## Workflow Steps & Diagram

1.  **Gather Rule Details:** Retrieve the rule logic/definition for `${RULE_ID}` using `list_security_rules`.
2.  **Gather Performance Data:** Retrieve historical alerts generated by the rule over `${REPORT_TIMEFRAME_DAYS}` using `get_security_alerts`. Analyze volume, severity, and potentially associated case statuses (TP/FP).
3.  **Gather Context:** Review related SOAR cases (`${CASE_ID}`) or tuning documentation if applicable.
4.  **Structure Report:** Organize information according to a standard template (referencing `.clinerules/reporting_templates.md`). Key sections might include: Rule Details (ID, Name, Logic Summary), Performance Metrics (Alert Volume, TP/FP Ratio if known), Key Findings/Observations, Tuning History/Recommendations (if applicable).
5.  **Generate Mermaid Diagram:** Create a Mermaid sequence diagram summarizing the *tools used to gather data for this report*.
6.  **Format Report:** Compile the synthesized information and the Mermaid diagram into a final Markdown report.
7.  **Generate report file:** Save the report with a standardized name (e.g., `./reports/detection_report_${RULE_ID}_${timestamp}.md`).
