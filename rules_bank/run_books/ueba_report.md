# Runbook: UEBA Report Analysis

## Objective

To analyze a User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) alert or report, investigate the anomalous activity, gather contextual information, and determine if it represents a genuine security threat or benign behavioral deviation. This runbook provides systematic analysis of behavioral anomalies using baseline comparison, activity correlation, and risk assessment methodologies.

## Scope

Focuses on analyzing UEBA findings, correlating with SIEM logs, user context, and historical behavioral patterns. Includes entity enrichment, timeline reconstruction, and risk assessment based on deviation severity and potential impact. Covers user activity analysis, resource access patterns, and anomaly investigation. May involve basic enrichment but excludes deep endpoint forensics or network traffic analysis unless specifically indicated by the anomaly type.

## Inputs

*   `${UEBA_ALERT_ID}` or `${CASE_ID}`: Identifier for the UEBA alert or associated SOAR case.
*   `${USER_ID}`: The primary user associated with the anomalous behavior.
*   `${ENTITY_ID}`: Any primary entity (e.g., hostname, resource) associated with the behavior.
*   `${ANOMALY_DESCRIPTION}`: Description of the anomalous behavior reported by the UEBA system.
*   *(Optional) `${BASELINE_INFO}`: Information about the user's normal baseline behavior, if available.*

## Tools

*   `secops-soar`: `get_case_full_details`, `list_alerts_by_case`, `list_events_by_alert`, `post_case_comment`
*   `secops-mcp`: `lookup_entity` (for user and entity), `search_security_events` (for detailed activity logs)
*   `gti-mcp`: (Relevant enrichment tools if IOCs are involved)
*   *(Potentially Identity Provider tools like `okta-mcp.lookup_okta_user`)*

## Workflow Steps & Diagram

1.  **Receive Alert/Case:** Obtain the UEBA alert details, associated user/entity, `${CASE_ID}` etc.
2.  **Gather Context:** Use `get_case_full_details` (if applicable). Use `lookup_entity` for `${USER_ID}` and `${ENTITY_ID}` to get SIEM context. *(Optional: Check IDP for user status/recent activity)*.
3.  **Analyze Specific Activity:** Use `search_security_events` to retrieve detailed logs corresponding to the timeframe and activity described in `${ANOMALY_DESCRIPTION}`.
4.  **Compare to Baseline:** Compare the observed activity against known baseline behavior (`${BASELINE_INFO}`) or historical patterns observed in SIEM logs. Identify deviations.
5.  **Enrich Associated Indicators:** If the anomalous activity involves specific IOCs (IPs, domains, files), enrich them using `lookup_entity` and GTI tools.
6.  **Synthesize Findings:** Combine UEBA anomaly details, SIEM logs, baseline comparison, and enrichment data. Determine if the activity is explainable, benign, or suspicious/malicious.
7.  **Document & Recommend:** Document findings and assessment in the SOAR case using `post_case_comment`. Recommend next steps: [Close as Benign/Explained | Monitor User/Entity | Escalate for Incident Response (Trigger relevant runbook like Compromised User Account Response)].
